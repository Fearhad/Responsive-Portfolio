                I am a father of 6, originally from Nova Scotia, currently residing in Trenton, Ontario. I've been married to my beautiful wife for 11 years. The past 16 years I have spent working for Convergys in a variety of positions including Technical Support Professional, Associate Trainer, and Mentor. Most recently, I have been a Team Leader for the past 5 years.

                My passion for programming started when my parents bought me my first computer, a Commodore 64. I entered in code for a Red Baron game I found in a magazine called Computer Gazette. I wanted to understand what all the basic instructions meant so I started reading books on the basic language.

                    At Convergys, I spent 2 years creating web applications. They were having an issue with a in-house tool that was performing poorly. I was tasked with creating a tool that was more efficient as soon as possible. It was a case management system that allowed dispatchers to assign cases to the employees. I finished it within three weeks and it replaced the old system.

                        I created over a dozen web applications for them over the next 2 years. It was a great experience and helped me decide to pursue a career in full stack web development.
